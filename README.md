# ATM-machine-project
Project Overview
This project simulates an ATM machine system where users can perform common banking transactions such as balance inquiries, cash withdrawals, deposits, and account creation. It is developed in C++ with the use of essential data structures, making it an ideal project for learning about basic data manipulation, file handling, and user interface design in C++.

Features
Account Management:

Create a new user account with details like name, account number, and initial balance.
Store user information in a file for persistent data storage.
Authentication System:

Prompt users to log in using an account number and PIN.
Implement a simple security check with limited login attempts to enhance user security.
Transaction Handling:

Check Balance: Retrieve and display the current balance of a logged-in user.
Deposit Money: Allow users to deposit money, updating their account balance.
Withdraw Money: Let users withdraw funds if sufficient balance is available, ensuring overdrafts are prevented.
Transaction History: Track transaction history (optional, using linked lists or vectors for managing multiple transactions).
Admin Functions (Optional):

Add an admin menu for managing accounts (view, delete, update).
Data Structures Used
Classes and Objects:

Account class to represent individual user accounts, with methods for deposit, withdraw, and balance inquiry.
File Handling:

Use file streams to store account information persistently, allowing the system to maintain account details even after program termination.
Arrays or Linked Lists:

To manage multiple accounts and transactions, arrays or linked lists can be used, especially if transaction history or a queue system for multiple ATMs is implemented.
Vectors (Optional):

For flexible account and transaction handling, vectors can dynamically grow as the number of users or transactions increases.
Benefits and Learning Outcomes
Understanding object-oriented programming through C++ classes.
Hands-on experience with file handling for data persistence.
Practical use of arrays, linked lists, and vectors.
Developing a user interface in C++ for a smooth interaction with the ATM.
Possible Extensions
Add encryption for PIN storage.
Develop a GUI for a more interactive user experience.
Integrate with a bank server simulation for real-time data access.
This project showcases fundamental banking operations with a clear user interface while teaching the essentials of data structures and C++ programming
